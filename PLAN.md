# KeyClean — Implementation Plan

Cross-platform keyboard cleaning utility: locks the keyboard, visualizes keypresses on a
virtual ISO 105-key layout, and suppresses input to the OS so the user can wipe their
physical keyboard without triggering commands.


## 1. Global Input Suppression — Feasibility

### Linux (X11)

**Feasible with `XGrabKeyboard`.**  Any X11 client can call `XGrabKeyboard` to redirect all
keyboard events to its own window.  This is the same mechanism screen lockers use.

- Library: `python-xlib` (optional dependency).
- Privilege: none required.
- Caveat: Alt+F4 may be intercepted by the WM before the grab takes effect if the window is
  not fullscreen or `override_redirect`.  Running fullscreen via pygame solves this.

### Linux (Wayland)

**Best-effort only.**  Wayland's security model prevents clients from grabbing global input.
SDL2 (≥ 2.28) supports `zwp_keyboard_shortcuts_inhibit_manager_v1`, which inhibits
compositor shortcuts (Super, Alt+Tab, etc.) while the window is focused and fullscreen on
supporting compositors (GNOME/Mutter, KDE/KWin, Sway).

- Kernel-level shortcuts (Ctrl+Alt+F*) cannot be blocked from userspace.
- The app will detect Wayland via `$XDG_SESSION_TYPE` and print a warning about limitations.

### macOS

**Feasible with `pynput`.**  Under the hood `pynput` uses `CGEventTap` from the Quartz
framework to intercept and suppress keyboard events system-wide.

- Privilege: Accessibility permission required (System Preferences → Privacy → Accessibility).
  The app will prompt the user on first launch.
- Touch Bar events are not covered; physical and external keyboards are.

### Windows

**Feasible with `pynput`.**  `pynput` uses `SetWindowsHookEx(WH_KEYBOARD_LL)` to install a
low-level keyboard hook that intercepts and can suppress all keystrokes.

- Privilege: no admin rights required.
- Caveat: `Ctrl+Alt+Del` (Secure Attention Sequence) always reaches the OS.  Documented as
  expected behavior.

### Fallback

If native grabbing fails or `pynput` is unavailable, the app falls back to "pygame-only" mode
(fullscreen + SDL event capture).  A warning banner is displayed in this mode since Alt+Tab
could still escape.


## 2. Handling High-Frequency Input (Keyboard Mashing)

USB HID keyboards poll at 125–1000 Hz.  Mashing 10 keys generates up to ~20,000 events/sec
on a 1000 Hz keyboard.

**Strategy — decouple input from rendering:**

1. The event loop drains the **entire** `pygame.event.get()` queue every frame.
2. Rendering is capped at **60 FPS** (one render pass per frame).
3. Key state is a `set[int]` of currently-pressed scancodes; updated per event, rendered once.
4. A key that is pressed and released between two frames simply increments the counter without
   ever being visually highlighted — this is correct and acceptable.
5. SDL2's internal event queue holds up to 65,535 events.  At 60 FPS we drain it every ~16 ms.
   Even at 20,000 events/sec that is ~333 events per frame — well within the buffer.
6. The strike counter is a plain `int` (Python ints are arbitrary precision).

**No throttling or debouncing is needed.**  The architecture is inherently safe.

## 4. Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| UI library | `pygame-ce` | Actively maintained, SDL2-backed, Wayland `shortcuts_inhibit` support |
| Input suppression (macOS/Windows) | `pynput` | Unified API, well-maintained, avoids raw `ctypes`/`pyobjc` |
| Input suppression (Linux X11) | `python-xlib` | `XGrabKeyboard` is the correct tool; `pynput` on X11 uses `Xlib` under the hood but doesn't expose grab |
| Input suppression (Linux Wayland) | SDL2 built-in | Only option from userspace; document limitations |
| Keyboard layout | ISO 105-key | User requirement |
| Window mode | Fullscreen | Better input suppression, user requirement |
| Exit phrase | `keys are clean` | User requirement — typed literally to exit |
| Exit button | "Done" button (mouse click) | Secondary exit method |
| Build backend | `hatchling` | Lightweight, modern, works with `uv` |
| Python version | 3.9+ | Broad compatibility |


## 5. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 — Project Scaffold

- Create `pyproject.toml` with all dependencies and metadata.
- Create `src/keyclean/__init__.py` (version string).
- Create `src/keyclean/__main__.py` (`python -m keyclean` entry point).
- Create `tox.ini` for Python 3.9–3.13 testing.
- Create `.gitignore` (Python + pygame + build artifacts).
- Create `LICENSE` (Unlicense text).
- Update `Makefile`: fix `test_upload`/`upload` targets to use `keyclean-*`.
- Verify `uv sync` and `uv run python -m keyclean` work (app starts and immediately exits).

### Phase 2 — Keyboard Layout Data

- Define the ISO 105-key layout in `keyboard_layout.py`:
  - Each key: `(row, col, width, height, label, pygame_keycode, scancode)`.
  - Rows: Esc/F-keys, number row, QWERTY, home row, bottom row, space bar row.
  - Include: numpad, arrows, Insert/Delete/Home/End/PgUp/PgDn block.
  - The extra ISO key (between left Shift and Z).
- Define visual constants in `config.py`: key size in pixels, gap, colors, font sizes.

### Phase 3 — Renderer

- `renderer.py`: pure rendering module, no input logic.
  - `draw_keyboard(surface, layout, pressed_keys)` — draws all keys; pressed keys highlighted.
  - `draw_counter(surface, count)` — persistent strike counter, top-right corner.
  - `draw_done_button(surface)` — clickable rectangle, returns its `Rect` for hit-testing.
  - `draw_warning_banner(surface, message)` — for fallback/Wayland mode warnings.
- Auto-scale the layout to fit the screen resolution.

### Phase 4 — Core App Loop

- `app.py`: `App` class and `main()` function.
- Flow:
  1. Initialize pygame, go fullscreen, hide mouse cursor (or keep for "Done" button).
  2. Acquire input grabber via `get_grabber()`.
  3. Main loop (60 FPS):
     - Drain all events from `pygame.event.get()`.
     - On `KEYDOWN`: add to `pressed_keys`, increment counter, feed char to safety sequence.
     - On `KEYUP`: remove from `pressed_keys`.
     - On `MOUSEBUTTONDOWN`: check hit on "Done" button → exit.
     - Render: keyboard, counter, button, optional warning banner.
  4. On exit: release grabber, quit pygame.

### Phase 5 — Safety Sequence

- `safety_sequence.py`:
  - `SafetySequence` class holding the target phrase (`"keys are clean"`).
  - Internal ring buffer (collections.deque with maxlen = len(phrase)).
  - `feed(char: str) -> bool`: appends char, returns `True` if buffer matches phrase.
  - Case-insensitive matching (so Caps Lock doesn't break it).
- Wire into `app.py`: on `KEYDOWN`, if the key maps to a printable char, feed it.

### Phase 6 — Input Grabbers

- `_base.py`: `AbstractGrabber` with `grab()` and `release()` methods.
- `_fallback.py`: no-op implementation; sets a flag for the warning banner.
- `_x11.py`: `XGrabKeyboard` on the pygame window's X11 window ID.
- `_pynput.py`: `pynput.keyboard.Listener` with `suppress=True` on macOS/Windows.
- `_wayland.py`: no-op (SDL2 handles it); sets a flag for the Wayland warning.
- `__init__.py` factory:
  ```
  platform → session type → try native grabber → fallback
  Linux + X11     → _x11.py (python-xlib)
  Linux + Wayland → _wayland.py (best-effort)
  macOS           → _pynput.py
  Windows         → _pynput.py
  any failure     → _fallback.py
  ```

### Phase 7 — Tests

- `test_safety_sequence.py`: feed exact phrase, partial, wrong chars, case variations.
- `test_keyboard_layout.py`: all 105 keys defined, no overlapping positions, all keycodes unique.
- `test_renderer.py`: mock `pygame.Surface`, verify `draw_*` functions call `blit`/`draw.rect`.
- `test_input_grabber.py`: factory returns correct grabber type per platform (mock `sys.platform`
  and env vars); grab/release lifecycle.
- `test_app.py`: simulate a sequence of `KEYDOWN`/`KEYUP` events, verify counter increments
  and exit on safety sequence.

### Phase 8 — Polish

- `tox.ini`: test matrix for Python 3.9–3.13.
- Verify `pylint` passes with the configured `max-line-length = 120`.
- Verify `autopep8` formatting.
- Write a brief `README.md` (installation, usage, exit methods, platform notes).
- Final `Makefile` cleanup.


## 6. Dependency Summary

| Package | Required | Platform | Purpose |
|---------|----------|----------|---------|
| `pygame-ce` ≥ 2.4.0 | always | all | UI, event loop, rendering |
| `pynput` ≥ 1.7.6 | optional | macOS, Windows | global keyboard suppression |
| `python-xlib` ≥ 0.33 | optional | Linux (X11) | `XGrabKeyboard` |
| `autopep8` | dev | all | code formatting |
| `pylint` | dev | all | linting |
| `pytest` | dev | all | testing |
| `pytest-mock` | dev | all | input simulation in tests |
| `pytest-cov` | dev | all | coverage reporting |
| `tox` | dev | all | cross-version test runner |
| `twine` | dev | all | PyPI upload |
| `build` | dev | all | wheel/sdist building |


## 7. Open Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Wayland compositor doesn't support `shortcuts_inhibit` | Warning banner; document known compositors |
| `pynput` `suppress=True` conflicts with pygame's own event handling | `pynput` listener runs in its own thread; pygame only reads its internal SDL queue; no conflict |
| macOS Accessibility permission not granted | Detect failure, fall back to pygame-only mode with warning |
| SDL2 version too old for Wayland inhibit | Check `pygame.get_sdl_version()` at startup; warn if < 2.28 |
| User types exit phrase accidentally during cleaning | Phrase `"keys are clean"` is 14 chars, highly unlikely from random mashing |
